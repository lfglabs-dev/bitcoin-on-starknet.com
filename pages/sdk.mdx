# Software Development Kits

To interact with Bitcoin data on Starknet, you'll need two components:
1. An SDK to generate the necessary proofs from Bitcoin Core.
2. The Cairo library to verify these proofs and provide the Bitcoin data to your smart contracts

## Cairo Library

Our Cairo library abstracts away the complexity of proof verification, allowing you to focus on using Bitcoin data in your Starknet smart contracts. Once proofs are generated and submitted using an SDK, you can use the library's high-level functions to access verified Bitcoin data structures.

You can find the library on GitHub at TODO

## TypeScript/JavaScript SDK


You can install the TypeScript/JavaScript SDK from npm:
```bash
npm install bitcoin-on-starknet
```
