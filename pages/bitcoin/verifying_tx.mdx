# Verifying Bitcoin Transactions on Starknet

## Overview

Verifying Bitcoin transactions on Starknet involves proving that a specific transaction is included in a Bitcoin block that's part of the canonical chain. This process uses Merkle proofs to demonstrate transaction inclusion without requiring the full block data.

## Prerequisites

- The transaction ID (txid) you want to verify
- The block header hash containing your transaction
- A Merkle proof for the transaction

## Understanding the Process

The verification process consists of three main steps:

1. **Confirm Block Header**: Verify that the block containing your transaction is part of Bitcoin's canonical chain on Starknet.
2. **Validate Merkle Proof**: Use the transaction's Merkle proof to verify its inclusion in the block.
3. **Parse Transaction Data**: Extract and verify the transaction details.

## Code Example
